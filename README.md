# Omniauth::DomainGroup

This is an unofficial OmniAuth strategy for authenticating with Domain Group. To get started, read the documentation at https://developer.domain.com.au

You will need to get permission from a Domain customer to be added to their account. Contact the Domain API team (api@domain.com.au) once you are ready.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-domain-group'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install omniauth-domain-group

## Usage with Rails & Devise

Add the following to `config/initializers/devise.rb`
```ruby
config.omniauth :domain_group,
    ENV['DOMAIN_GROUP_CLIENT_ID'],
    ENV['DOMAIN_GROUP_SECRET_KEY'],
    :scope => 'openid profile offline_access api_agencies_read'
```

Add `:domain_group` to the `:omniauth_providers` array for your devise model. e.g.

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  devise :omniauthable, :omniauth_providers => [:domain_group]
end
```

You can then access the url using the helper `user_domain_group_omniauth_authorize_path`

## Basic Usage

```ruby
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :domaing_group, ENV['DOMAIN_GROUP_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['DOMAIN_GROUP_SECRET_KEY'], scope: 'openid profile offline_access api_agencies_read'
end
```
